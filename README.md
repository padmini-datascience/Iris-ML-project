# Iris-ML-project
# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Classification Project
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies Machine Learning algorithms to the Iris dataset for flower classification.
# steps completed
- Data loading & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with scatter plots, boxplots, and heatmap
- Logistic Regression model â†’ Accuracy: 93%
##  Next Steps
- Try Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
- Compare model performances
- Visualize decision boundaries

# Applied Decision tree,Random forest,knn,SVC,naive bayes classification algorithms to the Data set.
# Got 93% accuracy across all the models.
