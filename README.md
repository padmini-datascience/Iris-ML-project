# Iris-ML-project
# üå∏ Iris Classification Project
## üìå Project Overview
This project applies Machine Learning algorithms to the Iris dataset for flower classification.
# steps completed
- Data loading & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with scatter plots, boxplots, and heatmap
- Logistic Regression model ‚Üí Accuracy: 93%
##  Next Steps
- Try Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
- Compare model performances
- Visualize decision boundaries

# Applied Decision tree,Random forest,knn,SVC,naive bayes classification algorithms to the Data set.
# Got 93% accuracy across all the models.
# Machine Learning Practice Notebooks

This repository contains my daily practice work on machine learning datasets.  

- **Day 3: Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset**
  - Preprocessed data (dropped ID column, handled target labels)
  - Applied 6 classification models
  - Logistic Regression achieved ~95% accuracy (cross-validation)
  - Precision ‚âà 0.95, Recall ‚âà 0.92 for malignant class
  - Next step: Threshold tuning to improve recall

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Threshold tuning for Logistic Regression (to improve recall for malignant cases)
- Try Precision-Recall curve visualization
- Explore other datasets (UCI, Kaggle) for practice

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
